# sphere-packing-evaluator

This is a simple program for evaluating the capacity of a container with spherical objects.

Online version of the program can be accessed at https://petermcc111.github.io/sphere-packing-evaluator/

Arrangement structures applied: (links to view the 3D model for respective structures)
- Simple cubic (http://www.chemtube3d.com/solidstate/_simplecubic(final).htm)
- Hexagonal closed-packed (http://www.chemtube3d.com/solidstate/_hcp(final).htm)
- Face-centered cubic (http://www.chemtube3d.com/solidstate/_ccp(final).htm)

Hexagonal closed-packed and face-centered cubic structures can theoretically achieve the highest average density.
Practically, cases might be found when simple cubic structure is actually better than the other two, thus all the three structures will be considered.
