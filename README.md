# sphere-packing-evaluator

This is a simple program for evaluating the capacity of a container with spherical objects.

Arrangement structures applied: 
- Simple cubic
- Hexagonal closed-packed
- Face-centered cubic

Hexagonal closed-packed and face-centered cubic structures can theoretically achieve the highest average density.
Practically, cases might be found when simple cubic structure is actually better than the other two, thus all the three structures will be considered.
